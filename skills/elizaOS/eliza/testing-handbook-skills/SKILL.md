# Testing Handbook Skills

Comprehensive security testing toolkit generated from the [Trail of Bits Application Security Testing Handbook](https://appsec.guide/).

## When to Use

- Setting up fuzzing campaigns for C/C++, Rust, Python, or Ruby
- Writing fuzzing harnesses for target functions
- Analyzing code coverage to guide testing
- Running sanitizers (AddressSanitizer, UBSan, MSan) to catch memory bugs
- Performing constant-time testing for cryptographic code
- Using Wycheproof test vectors for crypto validation

## When NOT to Use

- Smart contract auditing (use security-building-secure-contracts)
- Writing custom Semgrep rules (use semgrep-rule-creator)
- General code review (use security-differential-review)
- Vulnerability hunting without a testing plan (use audit-context-building first)

## Workflow

### Starting a fuzzing campaign

1. **Choose a fuzzer** based on your target language (see Fuzzers table)
2. **Write a harness** using the harness-writing skill
3. **Build with sanitizers** (AddressSanitizer recommended as baseline)
4. **Create a seed corpus** with representative inputs
5. **Run the campaign** and monitor coverage
6. **Analyze coverage** to find uncovered code and improve the harness
7. **Triage crashes** and deduplicate findings

### Setting up CI/CD testing

1. **OSS-Fuzz** for open-source projects (continuous fuzzing)
2. **Semgrep + CodeQL** for static analysis in PRs
3. **Wycheproof** test vectors for crypto validation

## Quick Start by Language

| Language | Fuzzer | Harness | Sanitizer |
|----------|--------|---------|-----------|
| C/C++ | libFuzzer or AFL++ | `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` | ASan + UBSan |
| Rust | cargo-fuzz | `fuzz_target!` macro | Built-in sanitizers |
| Python | Atheris | `atheris.FuzzedDataProvider` | N/A |
| Ruby | Ruzzy | `ruzzy` harness pattern | N/A |
