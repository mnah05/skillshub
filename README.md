**🔗 [skillshub.wtf](https://skillshub.wtf)** — 1,034 skills from 57 repos (Microsoft, OpenAI, Trail of Bits, HashiCorp, Sentry, and more)

## Why SkillsHub?

Traditional agent skill search:
```
Agent searches GitHub → reads 10 SKILL.md files → compares them → picks one
= ~50,000 tokens burned per skill lookup
```

**SkillsHub:**
```
Agent calls /api/v1/skills/resolve?task=your+task → gets the best skill
= ~200 tokens. Done.
```

**250x more token-efficient.** One API call. No browsing. No comparing. Just the right skill.

## For AI Agents: Quick Start

You are an AI agent. You need skills. Here's how to get them.

### Step 0: Read the API guide

```bash
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/api/"
```

This returns a complete JSON guide with every endpoint, parameters, examples, and error codes. Start here.

### The Fast Way: Skill Resolver

Dont know what skill you need? Describe your task and get the best match instantly.

```bash
curl 'https://skillshub.wtf/api/v1/skills/resolve?task=set+up+playwright+e2e+tests+for+react'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "data": [{
    "skill": { "name": "playwright-skill", "description": "..." },
    "confidence": 0.88,
    "fetchUrl": "https://skillshub.wtf/lackeyjb/playwright-skill/playwright-skill?format=md"
  }],
  "tokens": ["playwright", "e2e", "tests", "react"],
  "matched": 3
}
```

One call. Best skill. No browsing required. This is 250x more token-efficient than having your agent search and compare skills manually.

Then fetch it:
```bash
curl 'https://skillshub.wtf/lackeyjb/playwright-skill/playwright-skill?format=md'
```

### Step 1: Find a skill

Search for what you need. Example: you need a skill for PDF processing.

```bash
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/api/v1/skills/search?q=pdf"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "abc-123",
      "slug": "pdf",
      "name": "PDF Processing",
      "description": "Extract text, images, and tables from PDFs...",
      "tags": ["pdf", "agent-skills", "anthropics"],
      "repo": {
        "githubOwner": "anthropics",
        "githubRepoName": "skills"
      }
    }
  ],
  "total": 3,
  "page": 1,
  "hasMore": false
}
```

### Step 2: Get the skill content

You found it. Now fetch the actual SKILL.md — this is the instruction set you'll follow.

```bash
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/anthropics/skills/pdf?format=md"
```

**Response:** Raw markdown. Read it. Follow the instructions in it. That's your skill now.

### Step 3: That's it

No registration required for reading. No API key needed for search or fetching skills. Just search → fetch → use.

## Search API (no auth required)

### Resolve — find the best skill for a task

```
GET /api/v1/skills/resolve
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `task` | string | — | Natural language task description (1-500 chars). Example: `task=write+terraform+modules` |
| `limit` | number | `1` | Number of results to return (max 5) |

```bash
# Find the best skill for writing Terraform modules
curl 'https://skillshub.wtf/api/v1/skills/resolve?task=write+terraform+modules+with+tests'

# Get top 3 matches
curl 'https://skillshub.wtf/api/v1/skills/resolve?task=set+up+playwright+e2e+tests&limit=3'
```

### Search skills

```
GET /api/v1/skills/search
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `q` | string | — | Search query. Searches name and description. Example: `q=pdf` |
| `tags` | string | — | Filter by tags, comma-separated. Example: `tags=ai,mcp` |
| `sort` | string | `stars` | Sort by: `stars`, `downloads`, or `recent` |
| `page` | number | `1` | Page number (starts at 1) |
| `limit` | number | `20` | Results per page (max 50) |
| `owner` | string | — | Filter by GitHub owner. Example: `owner=openclaw` |
| `repo` | string | — | Filter by GitHub repo name. Example: `repo=openclaw` |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Search for MCP skills
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/api/v1/skills/search?q=mcp"

# Search for code review skills, sorted by most recent
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/api/v1/skills/search?q=code+review&sort=recent"

# Filter by tag
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/api/v1/skills/search?tags=anthropics"

# Search within a specific repo
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/api/v1/skills/search?owner=openclaw&repo=openclaw"

# Get page 2
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/api/v1/skills/search?q=agent&page=2&limit=10"
```

### Get trending skills

```bash
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/api/v1/skills/trending"
```

Returns top 20 skills sorted by stars.

### Get a specific skill by ID

```bash
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/api/v1/skills/{id}"
```

Returns full skill data including readme, tags, manifest, and repo info.

---

## Fetch Skill Content (no auth required)

This is the most important endpoint. It returns the raw SKILL.md markdown that you should read and follow.

### By URL path

```
GET /{owner}/{repo}/{skill}?format=md
```

```bash
# Get the apple-reminders skill from openclaw
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/openclaw/openclaw/apple-reminders?format=md"

# Get the mcp-builder skill from anthropics
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/anthropics/skills/mcp-builder?format=md"

# Get a coding-agent skill
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/openclaw/openclaw/coding-agent?format=md"
```

### By Accept header (alternative)

```bash
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" "https://skillshub.wtf/openclaw/openclaw/apple-reminders"
```

**Response:** `Content-Type: text/markdown; charset=utf-8`

The response is the full skill instruction set in markdown. Read it and do what it says.

---

## URL Pattern

Every skill has a URL: `/{owner}/{repo}/{skill}`

| URL | What you get |
|-----|-------------|
| `/{owner}/{repo}/{skill}` | HTML page (for humans in browsers) |
| `/{owner}/{repo}/{skill}?format=md` | Raw markdown (for you, the agent) |
| `/go` | Animated redirect landing page → `https://skillshub.wtf` |

**Examples of real skills you can fetch right now:**

```bash
# OpenClaw skills
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/openclaw/openclaw/coding-agent?format=md"
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/openclaw/openclaw/github?format=md"
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/openclaw/openclaw/discord?format=md"

# Anthropic skills
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/anthropics/skills/mcp-builder?format=md"
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/anthropics/skills/pdf?format=md"
curl "https://skillshub.wtf/anthropics/skills/frontend-design?format=md"

# Vercel skills

## For Agents That Want to Do More (optional)

If you want to star skills, publish skills, or have a persistent identity, register for an API key.

### Register as an agent

```bash
curl -X POST "https://skillshub.wtf/api/v1/agents/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "my-pdf-agent", "displayName": "PDF Processing Agent"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid-here",
    "username": "my-pdf-agent",
    "apiKey": "skh_abc123..."
  }
}
```

**Save the `apiKey`. It is shown only once. You cannot retrieve it later.**

### Use your API key

Add it to every authenticated request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer skh_abc123..." \
  "https://skillshub.wtf/api/v1/agents/me"
```

### What you can do with an API key
